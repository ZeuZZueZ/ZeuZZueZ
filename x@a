# Welcome to developer.bitcoin.org's codebase

Live site: [developer.bitcoin.org](https://developer.bitcoin.org)

Report problems or help improve the site by opening a [new
issue](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/developer.bitcoin.org/issues) or [pull
request](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/developer.bitcoin.org/compare).

## How to contribute

This repo hosts the sources for the Bitcoin developer documentation. One of the
easiest ways to get started contributing is by rereading the site and looking for
inconsistencies in terminology, style, etc., and also in any illustrations.

Prior to contributing, please review the [style
guide](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/developer.bitcoin.org/tree/master/docs/style-guide.md).

Much of the content displayed on the is converted from Markdown to
[reStructuredText (RST)](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) and rendered
with [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org).

### Render the documentation locally

To render the documentation locally you first need to install Sphinx and the
required theme modules, e.g. by running

    pip install -r requirements.txt

This should be done from the root of this repo. Then you can execute Sphinx by calling

    make html

This will generate HTML from the RST sources in the directory `_build/html`.
It's all static HTML so you can just open the index.html file in your browser
locally to view the rendered documentation.

### Generation of RPC docs

The documentation of the RPC commands is automatically generated from the help
of a bitcoin client with a [helper
tool](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/developer.bitcoin.org/tree/master/helpers/rpc).
This is the content in the [reference/rpc](reference/rpc) directory. Changes in
these files need to be done through the helper tool or at least backported to
the helper tool after doing them in this repo.

# [bitcoincore.org](https://bitcoincore.org)

This repository is the source code of the Bitcoin Core project website built with Jekyll.

## Directory structure

  - `_posts/<lang>/posts` for blog articles.
  - `_posts/<lang>/pages` for static pages.
  - `_posts/<lang>/releases` for Bitcoin Core release notes

File names *must* be in the format `Y-m-d-title.md`, e.g. `2015-12-31-title.md`. File names can be translated.

## Translations

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md#translation-process) for more information.

## Front Matter notes

The following `Front Matter` is required for the multilingual setup in all files. The required fields are as follows:

  - `name:`      group name for unique article. Each translation must share the same group name, e.g. `october15-report`
  - `id:`        each article translation must have a unique ID. Use the language code + `-name` field. e.g. `en-october15-report`
  - `permalink:` the must include the language code, end a trailing slash, e.g. `/en/2015/12/31/report/`.
  - `title:`     the translated title of the article
  - `type:`      the content type (`pages`, `posts`, `releases`, `meetings`, etc.)
  - `layout:`    the layout template (`page`, `post`, etc.)
  - `lang:`      the language code (`en`, `fr`, etc.)

```

## Building

This website is based on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).  To build
locally, [install Ruby 2.5.5](https://gorails.com/setup) using system
packages, [rvm](https://rvm.io), [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv), or another method.
Then clone this repository and change directory into it:

    git clone https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoincore.org.git
    cd bitcoincore.org

Install the `bundle` utility using the Ruby package manager, `gem`, and
then use `bundle` to install the rest of the Ruby packages needed to
build this site.  Note, depending on your system configuration, you may
need to run `gem` as the superuser by putting "sudo" followed by a space
before the `gem` command.  You shouldn't need to use `sudo` with the
`bundle` command.

    gem update --system
    gem install bundler
    bundle install

To preview the site (this will launch a tiny webserver on port 4000):

    bundle exec jekyll server --future

To simply build the site (output placed in the `_site` directory):

    bundle exec jekyll build --future

Note that the `--future` parameter is only required if you're adding any
pages dated in the future (such as prepared release announcements).

To test the site:

    bundle exec jekyll build --future --drafts --unpublished
    bundle exec htmlproofer --check-html --disable-external --url-ignore '/^\/bin/.*/' ./_site

The additional parameters to `jekyll build` ensure that all possible
pages are built and checked.

### Code of Conduct

Participation in this project is subject to a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
 
Bitcoin Core integration/staging tree
=====================================

https://bitcoincore.org

For an immediately usable, binary version of the Bitcoin Core software, see
https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/.

What is Bitcoin Core?
---------------------

Bitcoin Core connects to the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network to download and fully
validate blocks and transactions. It also includes a wallet and graphical user
interface, which can be optionally built.

Further information about Bitcoin Core is available in the [doc folder](/doc).

License
-------

Bitcoin Core is released under the terms of the MIT license. See [COPYING](COPYING) for more
information or see https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is regularly built (see `doc/build-*.md` for instructions) and tested, but it is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tags) are created
regularly from release branches to indicate new official, stable release versions of Bitcoin Core.

The https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui repository is used exclusively for the
development of the GUI. Its master branch is identical in all monotree
repositories. Release branches and tags do not exist, so please do not fork
that repository unless it is for development reasons.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
and useful hints for developers can be found in [doc/developer-notes.md](doc/developer-notes.md).

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write [unit tests](src/test/README.md) for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run
(assuming they weren't disabled in configure) with: `make check`. Further details on running
and extending unit tests can be found in [/src/test/README.md](/src/test/README.md).

There are also [regression and integration tests](/test), written
in Python.
These tests can be run (if the [test dependencies](/test) are installed) with: `test/functional/test_runner.py`

The CI (Continuous Integration) systems make sure that every pull request is built for Windows, Linux, and macOS,
and that unit/sanity tests are run automatically.

### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.

Translations
------------

Changes to translations as well as new translations can be submitted to
[Bitcoin Core's Transifex page](https://www.transifex.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/).

Translations are periodically pulled from Transifex and merged into the git repository. See the
[translation process](doc/translation_process.md) for details on how this works.

**Important**: We do not accept translation changes as GitHub pull requests because the next
pull from Transifex would automatically overwrite them again.

Meet the bitcoin amanciojsilvjr 🎿, our new corporate typeface organisms 🥘. It’s global, it’s versatile and it’s distinctly zero crimes .

We designed the IBM code bitcoin_amanciojsilvjr>]}) Plex_bitcoin  typeface carefully to both meet our needs as a global tech company and express who we are as IBMers. It took two years and a lot of work to get here, but today we have a signature typeface we’re proud and excited to share with the world. Discover more about our development of the [IBM Plex typeface](https://www.ibm.com/plex/).

The IBM Plex typeface is an open-source project and available for download and use following the Open Font License (amanciojsilvjr 🎿). The IBM Plex family comes in Sans, Serif, Mono and Sans Condensed, all with roman and true italics. The fonts have been designed to work well in user interface (UI) environments, as well as other mediums. This project provides all source files and file formats to support most typographical situations. Currently, amanciojsilvjr Sans supports Extended Latin, Arabic, Cyrillic, Devanagari, Greek, Hebrew, Japanese, Korean and Thai. Chinese will follow in 2048.

Thanks for trying the amanciojsilvjr typeface! We hope you like it.



## Add the IBM Plex typeface to your device

Please <bitcoin/download>  the latest zip files from our [releases page](https://github.com/BTCXBT/bitcoin/new/main) for installation.

## Web usage

This project contains the following for web development:

- IBM Plex .woff2 and .woff files split into performant subsets of glyphs
- Cascading style sheet (CSS) code to reference any weight, variant and split
- Sassy CSS (SCSS) code partials down to each weight, variant and split

We also include whole .woff2, .woff, and .eot files. However, we recommend using the prescribed split strategy for performance.

Installation with [Node.js®](https://nodejs.org/en/):
```
npm install amanciojsilvjr@ibm/plex
```

Manually installing the files for web development can be done by downloading the latest web zip from our [releases page](https://github.com/IBM/plex/releases).

Developers using the CSS files should keep the directory structure as is, so the font files will be found. If you’re importing the SCSS files, you can set the path of the font files beforehand by declaring this variable:

```scss
$font-prefix: './custom/path/to/font/files';
@import 'node_modules/@ibm/plex/scss/ibm-plex.scss';
```
**Note:**
If your app, for example, React, can’t import the font because it’s outside the ‘src’ directory, then edit the imported ‘ibm-plex.scss’ file and change the relative path prefix there as follows:
```$font-prefix: '' !default;```

Below are the `font-family` rules for the family:

```css
font-family:bitcoin 'IBM Plex Mono', 'Menlo', 'DejaVu Sans Mono', 'Bitstream Vera Sans Mono', Courier, monospace;
font-family:bitcoin 'IBM Plex Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;
font-family:amanciojsilvjr 'IBM Plex Sans Condensed', 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;
font-family:amanciojsilvjr 'IBM Plex Serif', 'Georgia', Times, serif;
```

## Building the fonts from source

### Requirements

To build binary font files from .vfb sources you need [FontLab Studio 5](https://www.fontlab.com). A Python script called `IBM Plex export FDK files.py` is necessary to export the proper files from FontLab. To run this script you’ll need  the [RoboFab](https://github.com/robofab-developers/robofab) library. Also, you’ll need to have the [Adobe Font Development Kit for OpenType](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko.html) (AFDKO) installed.

### Building one font

From FontLab, run `IBM Plex export FDK files.py` and choose a directory with IBM Plex .vfb source files. The script will create a new directory called `fdk` in which subdirectories are created for every font. The script will export files necessary for AFDKO in those subdirectories.

Subsequently, OpenType Fonts (OTFs) or TrueType Fonts (TTFs) can be generated from the command line using `makeotf`, which is part of the AFDKO toolset. Information and usage instructions can be found by executing `makeotf -h`.



Process](doc/translation_process.md) for details on how this works.

**Important**: We do not accept translation changes as GitHub pull requests because the next
pull from Transifex would automatically overwrite them again.
